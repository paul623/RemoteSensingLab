w: 20  # set the half window size, if 25, the window size is 25*2+1=51
num_similar_pixel: 20  # set number of similar pixels
min_class: 4.0  # set the estimated minimum and maximum number of classes
max_class: 6.0
num_pure: 100  # number of most purest coarse pixels in each class selected for change calculation
DN_min: 0.0  # set the range of DN value of the image,If byte, 0 and 255
DN_max: 10000.0
scale_factor: 16  # set the scale factor, it is integer=coarse resolution/fine resolution, e.g., 480/30=16
block_size: 30   # set the size of block, e.g., 20 means 20*20 coarse pixels, if process whole ETM scene, set 30~50
background: 0   # set the value of background pixels. 0 means that pixels will be considered as background if one of its bands= 0
background_band: 3 # which band with value = background indicating background pixels. Sometimes, background pixels have different values in different bands
# parameters for isodata classification
I: 20  # max number of iterations
maxStdv: 500  # threshold value for standard deviation (for split)
minDis: 500  # threshold value for pairwise distances (for merge)
minS: 200  # threshold value for min number in each cluster
M: 0.05  # threshold change in the clusters between each iter
